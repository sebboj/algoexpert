Shift Linked List | Difficulty: Hard

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k,
shifts the list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list) by k positions,
and returns its new head.

Sample Input: 
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5   //0 is the head
k = 2                               //right shift by 2

Sample Output:
4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3          //4 is the new head
